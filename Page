  <p> Everything feels so... different. You still don't know how you got here, but now you are glad you came. </p>
  <p> You feel so fast... so free... it seems as if you can travel so quickly now, and with this you run. </p>
  <p> You run and run and run until you have to come to a stop. You traveled a few miles, but it was only a minute. </p>
  <p> You are now facing a giant stone wall. There is (obviously) no way to get past it. </p>
