  <p> Everything feels so... different. You still don't know how you got here, but now you are glad you came. </p>
  <p> Your wounds have healed... you don't know how, you don't know why...</p>
  <p> You feel so fast... so free... it seems as if you can travel so quickly now, and with this you run. </p>
  <p> You run and run and run until you have to come to a stop. You traveled a few miles, but it was only a minute. </p>
  <p> You are now facing a giant stone wall. There is (obviously) no way to get past it. </p>
  <p> As you face the wall, you feel the strength of millions of lions, and as you attempt to kick down the wall with the force of s tsunami AND... nothing happens.</p>
  <p> The wall just stands there, and you actually didn't summon any superhuman streangth at all. After done imagining, though, you notice two doors. One to your left, and one to your right. </p>
  <p> The one on the left is made of silver, and has a cresent-shaped jem embedded into the middle, right where a peephole would be. </p>
  <p> The right one is made of gold, and has a sun-shaped jem embedded in the same place. </p>
